# 💫 About Me:

👋 Hi there! I'm RedLion8399, a passionate learner and aspiring software developer currently in the 10th grade. My journey in programming started with Scratch, and over the years, I've expanded my skills to include Python, C#, and more.

### My Learning Journey:
- 🏫 I chose computer science as my main focus in school and have been diving deeper into programming ever since.
- 🐍 A few years ago, I started learning Python and immediately loved its simplicity and versatility. Since then, I've worked on various projects, honing my skills in:
  - Writing unit tests
  - Using Git and GitHub
  - Following coding conventions
- 🌱 Currently, I'm exploring C# and Unity to create exciting game projects.

### Fun Fact:
Some of my school projects may look a bit different due to special rules and conditions we follow in class.
